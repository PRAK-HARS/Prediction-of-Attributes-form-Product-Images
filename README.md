# ðŸŒŸ **Multi-Output Attribute Classification for Visual Taxonomy** ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **Multi-Attribute Classification Project**! This repository contains three notebooks for categorizing various attributes of *Kurtis*, *Women's T-Shirts*, and *Sarees*. Each dataset explores different attributes, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

---

## **Overview**

This project is part of the Visual Taxonomy Competition by Meesho, focusing on multi-output classification of visual attributes across diverse product categories such as Sarees, Kurtis, and Womenâ€™s Tops & Tunics. The goal is to accurately predict multiple attributes for each category using advanced feature extraction techniques, cutting-edge machine learning models, and ensemble methods.

## **Datasets**
- **Train Dataset**: Contains images of products along with their respective attribute labels.
- **Test Dataset**: Contains images of products for which attributes need to be predicted.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Objectives**
- **Kurtis**: Multi-label classification with attributes such as fabric, pattern, sleeve type, etc.
- **Women's T-Shirts**: Predict pattern, sleeve length, and multicolor attributes.
- **Sarees**: Classify attributes like color, fabric, border type, and more.
- **Mens Tshirts**: Predict attributes like sleeve length, colar type, color,etc.
- **Women Tops & Tunics**: Predict attributes like color, occasion, fabric,etc.

## ðŸš€ **Modeling Approach**
**1. Initial Experiments with ResNet50**

- **Feature Extraction and Prediction:**

  - Utilized ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction.
  - Built separate models for each attribute, resulting in independent predictions.

- **Observation:** While ResNet50 provided a solid baseline, the results varied significantly across attributes and categories.


**2. Model Experiments with Random Forest and CatBoost**

Extracted features using ResNet50 and trained Random Forest and CatBoost classifiers for prediction.

**Notable Results:**

- **Sarees attr_4**: Achieved better performance using Random Forest.

- **Other Attributes**: CatBoost outperformed Random Forest in several cases.


**3. Incorporation of ViTs and VGG16**

Experimented with Vision Transformers (ViTs) and VGG16 for feature extraction:

- **ViTs**: Showed moderate improvement but were computationally expensive.

- **VGG16**: Delivered the best results overall for feature extraction, particularly in color-related attributes.


**4. Color Quantization for Color Attributes**

- **Technique**: Used K-Means clustering to extract dominant colors from images with 3 clusters.

- **Prediction Models**: Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression to classify attributes related to color.

- **Outcome**: Achieved competitive results for color-related attributes using this approach.


**5. Ensemble Techniques**

Applied stacking and weighted voting to enhance predictions:

- **Stacking**: Combined predictions from multiple models using a meta-classifier.

- **Weighted Voting**: Aggregated predictions with weights assigned based on model performance.
