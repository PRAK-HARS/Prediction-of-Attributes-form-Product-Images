# ðŸŒŸ **Multi-Output Attribute Classification for Visual Taxonomy** ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **Multi-Attribute Classification Project**! This repository contains three notebooks for categorizing various attributes of *Kurtis*, *Women's T-Shirts*, and *Sarees*. Each dataset explores different attributes, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

---

## **Overview**

This project is part of the Visual Taxonomy Competition by Meesho, focusing on multi-output classification of visual attributes across diverse product categories such as Sarees, Kurtis, and Womenâ€™s Tops & Tunics. The goal is to accurately predict multiple attributes for each category using advanced feature extraction techniques, cutting-edge machine learning models, and ensemble methods.

## **Datasets**
- **Train Dataset**: Contains images of products along with their respective attribute labels.
- **Test Dataset**: Contains images of products for which attributes need to be predicted.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Objectives**
- **Kurtis**: Multi-label classification with attributes such as fabric, pattern, sleeve type, etc.
- **Women's T-Shirts**: Predict pattern, sleeve length, and multicolor attributes.
- **Sarees**: Classify attributes like color, fabric, border type, and more.
- **Mens Tshirts**: Predict attributes like sleeve length, colar type, color,etc.
- **Women Tops & Tunics**: Predict attributes like color, occasion, fabric,etc.

## ðŸš€ **Modeling Approach**
### **1. Initial Experiments with ResNet50**

-**Feature Extraction and Prediction:**

--Utilized ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction.

Built separate models for each attribute, resulting in independent predictions.

Observation: While ResNet50 provided a solid baseline, the results varied significantly across attributes and categories.

2. Model Experiments with Random Forest and CatBoost

Extracted features using ResNet50 and trained Random Forest and CatBoost classifiers for prediction.

Notable Results:

Sarees attr_4: Achieved better performance using Random Forest.

Other Attributes: CatBoost outperformed Random Forest in several cases.

3. Incorporation of ViTs and VGG16

Experimented with Vision Transformers (ViTs) and VGG16 for feature extraction:

ViTs: Showed moderate improvement but were computationally expensive.

VGG16: Delivered the best results overall for feature extraction, particularly in color-related attributes.

4. Color Quantization for Color Attributes

Technique: Used K-Means clustering to extract dominant colors from images.

Prediction Models: Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression to classify attributes related to color.

Outcome: Achieved competitive results for color-related attributes using this approach.

5. Ensemble Techniques

Applied stacking and weighted voting to enhance predictions:

Stacking: Combined predictions from multiple models using a meta-classifier.

Weighted Voting: Aggregated predictions with weights assigned based on model performance.

Result: Improved F1 score and accuracy.
